## Karboardia

This **organization** has a single goal: to create programs and applications that are genuinely useful and address real societal needsâ€”not trivial apps like "Hello World."

Development can be done by any means, including fully using AI, as long as copyright laws are not violated.

P.S.: When we can meet needs faster than ever before, why not do it
